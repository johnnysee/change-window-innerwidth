# Window Inner Width App

A simple app that displays the inner width in pixels by dragging and making the window smaller/bigger.

## Code

Used React to practise my useState and useEffect understanding, but also using addEventListener since it was long time ago since I used it. 

Added some simple Semantic-UI styling!
